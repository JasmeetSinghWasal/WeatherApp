# About this project -
- This project is a basic React SPA which uses openweather API to fetch real time weather ocnditions and display in the app.
- User can change the temperature unit
- User can save the cities for later reference

# Future Scope -
- Signup and login to store user favourites permanently
- Populate city by autocomplete

# Assumptions -
- Do not run this app in Incognito. IT does'nt save sessino Storage  and app won;t work.
- By default I have added 3 cities in the sessionStorage symbolising user's preferences.
- If we re-open the browser it comes again however, it get's deleted. With use of database this can be mitigated.
